                <p class = "main_stuff"><img class = "gazorp" src = "pics/graves.jpg" title = "gazorpazorp" alt = "i like to dance"/>Finnaly us rick and morty fanboys finally have a release date yet it is stll not a date yet. Justin roland said that the new season would premire before the end of the year and maybe in a few weeks this is confimed on the reddit AMA they just completed on 11-8-2016 This is good new because we were told months ago that the new season 3 will start early next spring now that it is confirmed that they will be relasing the season prior to schedule make all of us fan weary because we might get the feeling that it was rushed out. Now Roland says that they are very exicted about the new season and has even pointed out that this might just be the best season that they have ever came up with.</p>
