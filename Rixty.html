            <h2>Summary of Episode 8, "Rixty Minutes" of Rick &amp; Morty</h2>
            <hr>
            <p class = "main_stuff">The family is watching the reality TV show The Bachelor, and Rick is complaining about the quality of the show. Jerry asks Rick to show them his idea of good television and Rick upgrades the cable to show programming from every conceivable dimension. They come across Jerry on TV which they are eager to watch but which Rick argues is unimportant. To quell them, he gives them a pair of goggles that allow them to see through the eyes of alternate reality versions of themselves. While initially satisfying, these realities reveal some uncomfortable truths and unearth certain hostile feelings.</p>
