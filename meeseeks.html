            <h2>Summary of Episode 5, "Meeseeks  and Destroy" Episode for Rick &amp; Morty</h2>
            <hr>
            <p class = "main_stuff">Morty thinks Rick's adventures are too dangerous and so they make a deal that allows Morty to be in charge of an adventure, which leads them in to a "Jack and the Beanstalk" type scenario. At the same time, the rest of the family is having troubles with Rick's "Meeseeks Box", a cube that spawns helpful blue creatures called Meeseeks that normally explode once they have fulfilled the user's goal. However, the Meeseeks conjured by Jerry are unable to help him improve his golf game and summon more Meeseeks to assist him, resulting in the conjured Meeseeks becoming increasingly frustrated from their prolonged existence as they resort to drastic actions in having Jerry achieve his goal.</p>
