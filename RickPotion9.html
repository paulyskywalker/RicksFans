            <h2>Summary of Episode 6, "Rick Potion #9"  Rick &amp; Morty</h2>
            <hr>
            <p class = "main_stuff">A dance at Morty's high school prompts him to ask Rick if he can create a potion that will make his pretty classmate Jessica find Morty attractive. However, because Jessica has the flu, the potion goes haywire and becomes airborne and causes nearly the whole population of Earth to fall for Morty save for blood relatives. Rick fixes up an antidote which does not produce its hoped results. Meanwhile, Jerry becomes concerned about Beth's fidelity. Eventually both plots cross paths. This results in Rick and Morty migrating to another reality where that reality's Rick successfully cures all of Earth, but he and that reality's Morty die in an experiment allowing Rick and Morty to assume their roles.</p>
