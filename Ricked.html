            <h2>Summary of Episode 9, "Something Ricked This Way Comes" Rick &amp; Morty</h2>
            <hr>
            <p class = "main_stuff">Summer reports to her first job in an antique shop run by the Devil. The shop sells items that fulfill a desire for the owner but come at a price making the item essentially worthless. The Devil gives Rick a microscope that Rick determines would have rendered him retarded with use. Meanwhile, Jerry and Morty are transported to Pluto due to Jerry's opinions on Pluto's planetary status. However, it is soon revealed that Pluto is shrinking due to corporate plutonium mining, and Jerry's opinions are being used to keep the citizens of Pluto in a perpetual state of confirmation bias. Jerry eventually realizes the truth and consequently he and Morty are deported back to Earth. To get back at the Devil, Rick sets up a competitive counter-business across the street that removes the curses and runs the Devil out of business.</p>
